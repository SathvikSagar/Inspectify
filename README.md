#  INSPECTIFy - Road Damage Detection & Management Platform

An AI-powered full-stack web application designed to detect, classify, report, and manage road infrastructure damage using state-of-the-art Computer Vision and Geospatial Mapping technologies.

---

##  Introduction

INSPECTIFy is built to assist municipalities and road maintenance teams in identifying and prioritizing road repairs efficiently. It leverages modern web technologies and cutting-edge AI models like **YOLO** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** to automate the road inspection process.

##  Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Damage Detection
- **Vision Transformers (ViT):** Automatically detects various types of road damage including cracks, potholes, and surface degradation.
- **YOLO:** Localizes damage areas with bounding boxes.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Quick image processing and analysis.
- **Damage Categorization:** Clear identification of damage types.

### 2. Severity Classification
- **Intelligent Scoring:** Classifies damage as low, medium, or severe.
- **Color-Coded Prioritization:** Highlights critical issues for fast response.

### 3. Smart Reporting
- **Auto-generated Reports:** Include severity, type, and repair suggestions.
- **Standardized Documentation:** Useful for record keeping and audits.

### 4. Geospatial Mapping
- **Leaflet Maps Integration:** Visualize damage location.
- **GPS Location Tracking:** Auto-detect coordinates on image upload.
- **Clustering:** Group nearby reports for efficient planning.

### 5. User Management System
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Regular Users: Submit and track damage
  - Authorities: Prioritize and assign repairs
  - Admins: Manage platform and users
- **Authentication:** Secure login with email verification
- **Dashboards:** Customized views based on user roles

### 6. Analytics Dashboard
- **Stats & Trends:** Visualize frequency, locations, and types of damage
- **Charts & Graphs:** Built with Recharts
- **Resource Planning:** Helps in better budget and effort allocation

##  Workflow

1. **Image Upload:** User captures or uploads an image.
2. **Location Tagging:** GPS coordinates are auto-fetched.
3. **AI Processing:** Models detect and classify road issues.
4. **Report Generation:** Damage type, severity, and suggestions are compiled.
5. **Review & Action:** Authorities review and generate repair orders.
6. **Tracking:** Reports are tracked through to completion.
7. **Verification:** Follow-up images can verify repairs.
