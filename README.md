# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# SafeStreet---Road-Damage-Detection-System
Our project leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to automate damage identification and prioritization from uploaded images. First, the ViT classifies the type of damage (e.g., cracks, dents, corrosion) and assesses its severity, drawing on learned features that capture subtle visual details. Next, the system generates a concise text summary that documents the specific damage type, severity level, and recommended repair priority. This integrated approach streamlines inspection workflows, cuts down manual evaluation, and delivers consistent, data-driven insightsâ€”particularly useful for industries like insurance, automotive, construction, or manufacturing. By combining powerful vision models with intelligent text generation, the project ensures both accurate visual analysis and clear, actionable reporting for damage assessment.
